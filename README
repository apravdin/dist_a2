Detailed report can be found in `Report.pdf` in the root directory

=========================
Requirements
=========================

pthread - both for the RPC lib and binder executable

=========================
Compiling
=========================

NOTE:   The makefile will compile any .cc files found in the root directory
        and link with all the .o files found in the src directory
        and link with librpc
        The respective executable will have the extension .out

> cd ROOT_DIR
> make

This will generate `./binder.out` and `src/librpc`

=========================
Cleaning
=========================

> cd ROOT_DIR
> make clean

=========================
Running
=========================

> ./binder.out

This will start the binder and display the `BINDER_ADDRESS` and `BINDER_PORT`.

> ./server.out

This will start up the example server provided with this assignment.

> ./client1.out

Same as server except the client.
